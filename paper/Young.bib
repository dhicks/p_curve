  abstract = {In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of probability, Jeffresy developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpies was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following points: From Jeffrey's Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor of a null hypothesis. Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external information into the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis. Bayes factors are very general and do not require alternative models to be nested. Several techniques are available for computing Bayes factors, including asymptotic approximations that are easy to compute using the output from standard packages that maximize likelihoods. In "non-Bayesian significance tests. The Schwarz criterion (or BIC) gives a rough approximation to the logarithm of the Bayes factor, which is easy to use and does not require evaluation of prior distributions. When one is interested in estimation or prediction, Bayes factors may be converted to weights to be attached to various models so that a composite estimate or prediction may be obtained that takes account of structural or model uncertainty. Algorithms have been proposed that allow model uncertainty to be taken into account when the class of models initially considered is very large. Bayes factors are useful for guiding an evolutionary model-building process. It is important, and feasible, to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the prior distributions used.},

This book pulls back the cover on disagreements between experts charged with restoring integrity to science. It denies two pervasive views of the role of probability in inference: to assign degrees of belief, and to control error rates in a long run. If statistical consumers are unaware of assumptions behind rival evidence reforms, they can't scrutinize the consequences that affect them (in personalized medicine, psychology, etc.). The book sets sail with a simple tool: if little has been done to rule out flaws in inferring a claim, then it has not passed a severe test. Many methods advocated by data experts do not stand up to severe scrutiny and are in tension with successful strategies for blocking or accounting for cherry picking and selective reporting. Through a series of excursions and exhibits, the philosophy and history of inductive inference come alive. Philosophical tools are put to work to solve problems about science and pseudoscience, induction and falsification.},

  abstract = {Background
Acute myocardial infarction is triggered by various factors, such as physical exertion, stressful events, heavy meals, or increases in air pollution. However, the importance and relevance of each trigger are uncertain. We compared triggers of myocardial infarction at an individual and population level.
Methods
We searched PubMed and the Web of Science citation databases to identify studies of triggers of non-fatal myocardial infarction to calculate population attributable fractions (PAF). When feasible, we did a meta-regression analysis for studies of the same trigger.
Findings
Of the epidemiologic studies reviewed, 36 provided sufficient details to be considered. In the studied populations, the exposure prevalence for triggers in the relevant control time window ranged from 0·04\% for cocaine use to 100\% for air pollution. The reported odds ratios (OR) ranged from 1·05 to 23·7. Ranking triggers from the highest to the lowest OR resulted in the following order: use of cocaine, heavy meal, smoking of marijuana, negative emotions, physical exertion, positive emotions, anger, sexual activity, traffic exposure, respiratory infections, coffee consumption, air pollution (based on a difference of 30 μg/m3 in particulate matter with a diameter {$<$}10 μm [PM10]). Taking into account the OR and the prevalences of exposure, the highest PAF was estimated for traffic exposure (7·4\%), followed by physical exertion (6·2\%), alcohol (5·0\%), coffee (5·0\%), a difference of 30 μg/m3 in PM10 (4·8\%), negative emotions (3·9\%), anger (3·1\%), heavy meal (2·7\%), positive emotions (2·4\%), sexual activity (2·2\%), cocaine use (0·9\%), marijuana smoking (0·8\%) and respiratory infections (0·6\%).
Interpretation
In view of both the magnitude of the risk and the prevalence in the population, air pollution is an important trigger of myocardial infarction, it is of similar magnitude (PAF 5–7\%) as other well accepted triggers such as physical exertion, alcohol, and coffee. Our work shows that ever-present small risks might have considerable public health relevance.
Funding
The research on air pollution and health at Hasselt University is supported by a grant from the Flemish Scientific Fund (FWO, Krediet aan navorsers/G.0873.11), tUL-impulse financing, and bijzonder onderzoeksfonds (BOF) and at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven by the sustainable development programme of BELSPO (Belgian Science Policy).},

We start by reviewing why current analysis strategies for observational data tend to produce findings that fail to replicate. We then argue that there is a real need for simple and objective statistical strategies that yield findings more likely to be dependable. Our proposed way forward is to focus on the empirical distribution of local treatment differences, LTDs, which reveal heterogeneity in effect-sizes. The LTD is the difference in mean outcomes for treated and control patients within a cluster of patients relatively well matched on their observed pretreatment characteristics. Because we focus on only one question (comparing two alternative treatment choices for a given disease or condition) and clustering is nonparametric, our proposed approach is more simple and objective than commonly used statistical analysis strategies. By studying graphical displays of information from an LTD distribution, a doctor and patient not only can see a full picture of current treatment outcomes but also can make a truly well-informed, individualized treatment choice.},

The alternative strategy known as local control first generates local, nonparametric effect-size estimates (fair treatment comparisons) and only then asks whether the observed variation in these local estimates can be predicted from potential confounding factors. Here, we illustrate application of local control to a historical air pollution data set describing a “natural experiment” initiated by the federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970.

  abstract = {Background
It is agreed that high level radon exposure is harmful to humans. However, some published literature suggests that low levels of radon show no adverse effects or may even be protective. Claims made using traditional methods of analysis on observational data often fail to replicate. Here, we use a simple, alternative data-analytic strategy for examining effects of low-level indoor radon exposure on lung cancer mortality. One objective will be to demonstrate that local population characteristics can alter expected effects.
Methods
Observational data on indoor radon exposure levels and lung cancer mortality for 2881 U.S. counties were obtained from federal and state governmental agencies. A new “statistical thinking” step-by-step analysis strategy called Local Control (LC) allows us to perform analyses of observational data that are more objective and “fair” than regression-like methods. LC analytical strategy makes as few and as realistic assumptions as possible. As a result, key LC inferences are nonparametric, and estimates of potentially heterogeneous treatment effect-sizes are robust.
Results
Our LC analyses suggest that lung cancer mortality usually tends to decrease as background radon exposure increases. Local rank correlation (LRC) effect-sizes are shown to be predictable from confounding local characteristics like percentage of residents over 65, percentage of residents who currently smoke and percentage of obese residents.
Conclusions
At low indoor radon exposure levels, reverse (negative) LRCs between radon exposure level and lung cancer mortality predominate. The strengths of these associations vary with local demographics.},

  abstract = {Background: Many researchers have studied the relationship between diet and
health. There are papers showing an association between the consumption of
sugar-sweetened beverages and Type 2 diabetes. Many meta-analyses use
individual studies that do not adjust for multiple testing or multiple modeling
and thus provide biased estimates of effect. Hence the claims reported in a
meta-analysis paper may be unreliable if the primary papers do not ensure
unbiased estimates of effect. Objective: Determine the statistical reliability
of 10 papers and indirectly the reliability of the meta-analysis study. Method:
Ten primary papers used in a meta-analysis paper and counted the numbers of
outcomes, predictors, and covariates. We estimated the size of the potential
analysis search space available to the authors of these papers; i.e. the number
of comparisons and models available. Since we noticed that there were
differences between predictors and covariates cited in the abstract and in the
text, we applied this formula to information found in the abstracts, Space A,
as well as the text, Space T, of each primary paper. Results: The median and
range of the number of comparisons possible across the primary papers are 6.5
and (2-12,288) for abstracts, and 196,608 and (3,072-117,117,952) the texts.
Note that the median of 6.5 for Space A is misleading as each primary study has
60-165 foods not mentioned in the abstract. Conclusion: Given that testing is
at the 0.05 level and the number of comparisons is very large, nominal
statistical significance is very weak support for a claim. The claims in these
papers are not statistically supported and hence are unreliable. Thus, the
claims of the meta-analysis paper lack evidentiary confirmation.},

  abstract = {Statistics investigates and develops specific methods forevaluating hypotheses in the light of empirical facts. A method iscalled statistical, and thus the subject of study in statistics, if itrelates facts and hypotheses of a particular kind: the empirical factsmust be codified and structured into data sets, and the hypothesesmust be formulated in terms of probability distributions over possibledata sets. The philosophy of statistics concerns the foundations andthe proper interpretation of statistical methods, their input, andtheir results.  Since statistics is relied upon in almost allempirical scientific research, serving to support and communicatescientific findings, the philosophy of statistics is of key importanceto the philosophy of science. It has an impact on the philosophicalappraisal of scientific method, and on the debate over the epistemicand ontological status of scientific theory., The philosophy of statistics harbors a large variety of topics anddebates. Central to these is the  problem of induction,which concerns the justification of inferences or procedures thatextrapolate from data to predictions and general facts. Furtherdebates concern the interpretation of the probabilitiesthat are used in statistics, and the wider theoretical frameworkthat may ground and justify the correctness of statistical methods. Ageneral introduction to these themes is given in Section 1 and Section 2.  Section 3 and  Section 4 provide an account of howthese themes play out in the two major theories of statistical method,classical and Bayesian statistics respectively. Section 5directs attention to the notion of a statistical model, covering modelselection and simplicity, but also discussing statistical techniquesthat do not rely on statistical models.  Section 6 brieflymentions relations between the philosophy of statistics and severalother themes from the philosophy of science, including  confirmation theory, evidence,  causality, measurement, and scientificmethodology in general.},

  abstract = {Background
Acute exposure to air pollution has been linked to myocardial infarction, but its effect on heart failure is uncertain. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between air pollution and acute decompensated heart failure including hospitalisation and heart failure mortality.
Methods
Five databases were searched for studies investigating the association between daily increases in gaseous (carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone) and particulate (diameter {$<$}2·5 μm [PM2·5] or {$<$}10 μm [PM10]) air pollutants, and heart failure hospitalisations or heart failure mortality. We used a random-effects model to derive overall risk estimates per pollutant.
Findings
Of 1146 identified articles, 195 were reviewed in-depth with 35 satisfying inclusion criteria. Heart failure hospitalisation or death was associated with increases in carbon monoxide (3·52\% per 1 part per million; 95\% CI 2·52–4·54), sulphur dioxide (2·36\% per 10 parts per billion; 1·35–3·38), and nitrogen dioxide (1·70\% per 10 parts per billion; 1·25–2·16), but not ozone (0·46\% per 10 parts per billion; −0·10 to 1·02) concentrations. Increases in particulate matter concentration were associated with heart failure hospitalisation or death (PM2·5 2·12\% per 10 μg/m3, 95\% CI 1·42–2·82; PM10 1·63\% per 10 μg/m3, 95\% CI 1·20–2·07). Strongest associations were seen on the day of exposure, with more persistent effects for PM2·5. In the USA, we estimate that a mean reduction in PM2·5 of 3·9 μg/m3 would prevent 7978 heart failure hospitalisations and save a third of a billion US dollars a year.
Interpretation
Air pollution has a close temporal association with heart failure hospitalisation and heart failure mortality. Although more studies from developing nations are required, air pollution is a pervasive public health issue with major cardiovascular and health economic consequences, and it should remain a key target for global health policy.

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies
Data sources Medline, Embase, Global Health, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Web of Science searched to January 2014 with no language restrictions.
Eligibility criteria Studies investigating the short term associations (up to lag of seven days) between daily increases in gaseous pollutants (carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone) and particulate matter ({$<$}2.5 µm or {$<$}10 µm diameter (PM2.5 and PM10)), and admission to hospital for stroke or mortality.
Main outcome measures Admission to hospital and mortality from stroke.
Results From 2748 articles, 238 were reviewed in depth with 103 satisfying our inclusion criteria and 94 contributing to our meta-estimates. This provided a total of 6.2 million events across 28 countries. Admission to hospital for stroke or mortality from stroke was associated with an increase in concentrations of carbon monoxide (relative risk 1.015 per 1 ppm, 95\% confidence interval 1.004 to 1.026), sulphur dioxide (1.019 per 10 ppb, 1.011 to 1.027), and nitrogen dioxide (1.014 per 10 ppb, 1.009 to 1.019). Increases in PM2.5 and PM10 concentration were also associated with admission and mortality (1.011 per 10 μg/m3 (1.011 to 1.012) and 1.003 per 10 µg/m3 (1.002 to 1.004), respectively). The weakest association was seen with ozone (1.001 per 10 ppb, 1.000 to 1.002). Strongest associations were observed on the day of exposure with more persistent effects observed for PM2·5.
Conclusion Gaseous and particulate air pollutants have a marked and close temporal association with admissions to hospital for stroke or mortality from stroke. Public and environmental health policies to reduce air pollution could reduce the burden of stroke.

Data processing often involves choices among several reasonable options for excluding, transforming, and coding data. We suggest that instead of performing only one analysis, researchers could perform a multiverse analysis, which involves performing all analyses across the whole set of alternatively processed data sets corresponding to a large set of reasonable scenarios. Using an example focusing on the effect of fertility on religiosity and political attitudes, we show that analyzing a single data set can be misleading and propose a multiverse analysis as an alternative practice. A multiverse analysis offers an idea of how much the conclusions change because of arbitrary choices in data construction and gives pointers as to which choices are most consequential in the fragility of the result.},

Several factors call causation and even association into question, for example multiple testing and multiple modeling, publication bias and confirmation bias. Many published studies are difficult or impossible to reproduce because of lack of access to confidential data sources. Here we make publically available a dataset containing daily air quality levels, PM2.5 and ozone, daily temperature levels, minimum and maximum and daily maximum relative humidity levels for the eight most populous California air basins, thirteen years, {$>$}2M deaths, over 37,000 exposure days. The data are analyzed using standard time series analysis, and a sensitivity analysis is computed varying model parameters, locations and years. Our analysis finds little evidence for association between air quality and acute deaths. These results are consistent with those for the widely cited NMMAPS dataset when the latter are restricted to California. The daily death variability was mostly explained by time of year or weather variables; Neither PM2.5 nor ozone added appreciably to the prediction of daily deaths. These results call into question the widespread belief that association between air quality and acute deaths is causal/near-universal.},

If there are many questions under consideration, and there is no adjustment for multiple testing or multiple modeling, then unadjusted p-values are totally unreliable making claims unreliable. Our idea is to determine the statistical reliability of eight papers published in Environmental Health Perspectives that were used in meta-analysis papers appearing in Lancet and JAMA. We counted the number of outcomes, air quality predictors, time lags and covariates examined in each paper. We estimate the multiplicity of questions that could be asked and the number of models that could be constructed. The results were that the median numbers of comparisons possible for multiplicity, models and search space were 135, 128, and 9568 respectively. Given the large search spaces, finding a small number of nominally significant results is not unusual at all. The claims in these eight papers are not statistically supported so these papers are unreliable as are the meta-analysis papers that use them.},

  abstract = {It is well-known that claims coming from observational studies often fail to replicate when rigorously re-tested. The technical problems include multiple testing, multiple modeling and bias. Any or all of these problems can give rise to claims that will fail to replicate. There is a need for statistical methods that are easily applied, are easy to understand, and are likely to give reliable results. In particular, simple ways for reducing the influence of bias are essential. In this paper, the Local Control method developed by Robert Obenchain is explicated using a small air quality/longevity data set first analyzed in the New England Journal of Medicine. The benefits of our paper are twofold. First, we describe a reliable strategy for analysis of observational data. Second and importantly, the global claim that longevity increases with improvements in air quality made in the NEJM paper needs to be modified. There is subgroup heterogeneity in the effect of air quality on longevity (one size does not fit all), and this heterogeneity is largely explained by factors other than air quality.},

Meta-analyses are questionable when based on data from observational studies which are often unreliable. We examine the reliability of the base studies used in an air quality/heart attack meta-analysis and the resulting meta-analysis. A meta-analysis study that includes 14 observational air quality/heart attack studies is examined for its statistical reliability. We use simple counting to evaluate the reliability of the base papers and a p-value plot of the p-values from the base studies to examine study heterogeneity. We find that the base papers have the potential for massive multiple testing and multiple modeling with no statistical adjustments. Statistics coming from the base papers are not guaranteed to be unbiased, a requirement for a valid meta-analysis. There is study heterogeneity for the base papers with strong evidence for so called p-hacking in some, possibly many, of the studies. We make two observations: there are many claims at issue in each of the 14 base studies so uncorrected multiple testing is a serious issue. We find that some of the base papers exhibit the characteristics of p-hacking and are therefore not reliable; the resulting meta-analysis is not reliable.},

Currently, the association between air quality and acute deaths is usually taken as evidence for causality. As air quality has markedly improved since 1952, do contemporary datasets support this view? We use a large dataset, eight air basins in California for the years 2004–2007, to examine the possible association of ozone and PM2.5 with acute deaths after statistically removing seasonal and weather effects. Our analysis dataset is available on request. We conducted a regression-corrected, case-crossover analysis for all non-accidental deaths age 75 and older. We used stepwise regression to examine three causes of death. After seasonal and weather adjustments, there was essentially no predictive power of ozone or PM2.5 for acute deaths. The case-crossover analysis produced odds ratio very close to 1.000 (no effect). The very narrow confidence limits indicated good statistical power. We study recent air quality in both time-stratified, symmetric, bidirectional case-crossover and time series regression and both give consistent results. There is no statistically significant association between either ozone or PM2.5 and acute human mortality. In the absence of an association, causality is in question.},
