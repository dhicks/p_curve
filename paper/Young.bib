  abstract = {Simulation studies use computer intensive procedures to assess the performance of a variety of statistical methods in relation to a known truth. Such evaluation cannot be achieved with studies of real data alone. Designing high-quality simulations that reflect the complex situations seen in practice, such as in prognostic factors studies, is not a simple process. Unfortunately, very few published simulation studies provide sufficient details to allow readers to understand fully all the processes required to design a simulation study. When planning a simulation study, it is recommended that a detailed protocol be produced, giving full details of how the study will be performed, analysed and reported. This paper details the important considerations necessary when designing any simulation study, including defining specific objectives of the study, determining the procedures for generating the data sets and the number of simulations to perform. A checklist highlighting the important considerations when designing a simulation study is provided. A small review of the literature identifies the current practices within published simulation studies. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

But, since science draws conclusions based on limited empirical evidence, there is always a chance that a scientific inference will be incorrect. That chance, known as inductive risk, is endemic to science. Though inductive risk has always been present in scientific practice, the role of values in responding to it has only recently gained extensive attention from philosophers, scientists, and policy-makers. Exploring Inductive Risk brings together a set of eleven concrete case studies with the goals of illustrating the pervasiveness of inductive risk, assisting scientists and policymakers in responding to it, and moving theoretical discussions of this phenomenon forward. The case studies range over a wide variety of scientific contexts, including the drug approval process, high energy particle physics, dual-use research, climate science, research on gender disparities in employment, clinical trials, and toxicology. The book includes an introductory chapter that provides a conceptual introduction to the topic and a historical overview of the argument that values have an important role to play in responding to inductive risk, as well as a concluding chapter that synthesizes important themes from the book and maps out issues in need of further consideration.},

  abstract = {Background:Over the last several decades, scientists and social groups have frequently raised concerns about politicization or political interference in regulatory science. Public actors (environmentalists and industry advocates, politically aligned public figures, scientists and political commentators, in the United States as well as in other countries) across major political-regulatory controversies have expressed concerns about the inappropriate politicization of science. Although we share concerns about the politicization of science, they are frequently framed in terms of an ideal of value-free science, according to which political and economic values have no legitimate role to play in science. For several decades, work in philosophy of science has identified serious conceptual and practical problems with the value-free ideal.Objectives:Our objectives are to discuss the literature regarding the conceptual and practical problems with the value-free ideal and offer a constructive alternative to the value-free ideal.Discussion:We first discuss the prevalence of the value-free ideal in regulatory science, then argue that this ideal is self-undermining and has been exploited to delay protective regulation. To offer a constructive alternative, we analyze the relationship between the goals of regulatory science and the standards of good scientific activity. This analysis raises questions about the relationship between methodological and practical standards for good science, tensions among various important social goods, and tensions among various social interests. We argue that the aims of regulatory science help to legitimize value-laden choices regarding research methods and study designs. Finally, we discuss how public deliberation, adaptive management, and community-based participatory research can be used to improve the legitimacy of scientists as representatives of the general public on issues of environmental knowledge.Conclusions:Reflecting on the aims of regulatory science—such as protecting human health and the environment, informing democratic deliberation, and promoting the capacities of environmental justice and Indigenous communities—can clarify when values have legitimate roles in regulatory science.  https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP3317},

  abstract = {Background: Particulate matter (PM) in outdoor air pollution was recently designated a Group I carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). This determination was based on the evidence regarding the relationship of PM2.5 and PM10 to lung cancer risk; however, the IARC evaluation did not include a quantitative summary of the evidence. Objective: Our goal was to provide a systematic review and quantitative summary of the evidence regarding the relationship between PM and lung cancer. Methods: We conducted meta-analyses of studies examining the relationship of exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 with lung cancer incidence and mortality. In total, 18 studies met our inclusion criteria and provided the information necessary to estimate the change in lung cancer risk per 10-μg/m3 increase in exposure to PM. We used random-effects analyses to allow between-study variability to contribute to meta-estimates. Results: The meta-relative risk for lung cancer associated with PM2.5 was 1.09 (95\% CI: 1.04, 1.14). The meta-relative risk of lung cancer associated with PM10 was similar, but less precise: 1.08 (95\% CI: 1.00, 1.17). Estimates were robust to restriction to studies that considered potential confounders, as well as subanalyses by exposure assessment method. Analyses by smoking status showed that lung cancer risk associated with PM2.5 was greatest for former smokers [1.44 (95\% CI: 1.04, 2.01)], followed by never-smokers [1.18 (95\% CI: 1.00, 1.39)], and then current smokers [1.06 (95\% CI: 0.97, 1.15)]. In addition, meta-estimates for adenocarcinoma associated with PM2.5 and PM10 were 1.40 (95\% CI: 1.07, 1.83) and 1.29 (95\% CI: 1.02, 1.63), respectively. Conclusion: The results of these analyses, and the decision of the IARC Working Group to classify PM and outdoor air pollution as carcinogenic (Group 1), further justify efforts to reduce exposures to air pollutants that can arise from many sources.

In this comment, employing regulatory uses of high-throughput toxicology at the US Environmental Protection Agency as a case study, I respond to some of their claims about the notion of “pragmatic necessity.” I conclude that, while an inductive risk framework has some significant limitations, it is still conceptually and rhetorically valuable.},

  abstract = {Concerns about a crisis of mass irreplicability across scientific fields (“the replication crisis”) have stimulated a movement for open science, encouraging or even requiring researchers to publish their raw data and analysis code. Recently, a rule at the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) would have imposed a strong open data requirement. The rule prompted significant public discussion about whether open science practices are appropriate for fields of environmental public health. The aims of this paper are to assess (1) whether the replication crisis extends to fields of environmental public health; and (2) in general whether open science requirements can address the replication crisis. There is little empirical evidence for or against mass irreplicability in environmental public health specifically. Without such evidence, strong claims about whether the replication crisis extends to environmental public health — or not — seem premature. By distinguishing three concepts — reproducibility, replicability, and robustness — it is clear that open data initiatives can promote reproducibility and robustness but do little to promote replicability. I conclude by reviewing some of the other benefits of open science, and offer some suggestions for funding streams to mitigate the costs of adoption of open science practices in environmental public health.},

  abstract = {In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of probability, Jeffresy developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpies was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following points: From Jeffrey's Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor of a null hypothesis. Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external information into the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis. Bayes factors are very general and do not require alternative models to be nested. Several techniques are available for computing Bayes factors, including asymptotic approximations that are easy to compute using the output from standard packages that maximize likelihoods. In "non-Bayesian significance tests. The Schwarz criterion (or BIC) gives a rough approximation to the logarithm of the Bayes factor, which is easy to use and does not require evaluation of prior distributions. When one is interested in estimation or prediction, Bayes factors may be converted to weights to be attached to various models so that a composite estimate or prediction may be obtained that takes account of structural or model uncertainty. Algorithms have been proposed that allow model uncertainty to be taken into account when the class of models initially considered is very large. Bayes factors are useful for guiding an evolutionary model-building process. It is important, and feasible, to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the prior distributions used.},

  abstract = {Background: An irreproducibility crisis currently afflicts a wide range of scientific disciplines, including public health and biomedical science. A study was undertaken to assess the reliability of a meta-analysis examining whether air quality components (carbon monoxide, particulate matter 10 µm and 2.5 µm (PM10 and PM2.5), sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and ozone) are risk factors for asthma exacerbation. Methods: The number of statistical tests and models were counted in 17 randomly selected base papers from 87 used in the meta-analysis. Confidence intervals from all 87 base papers were converted to p-values. p-value plots for each air component were constructed to evaluate the effect heterogeneity of the p-values. Results: The number of statistical tests possible in the 17 selected base papers was large, median = 15,360 (interquartile range = 1536–40,960), in comparison to results presented. Each p-value plot showed a two-component mixture with small p-values \&lt; 0.001 while other p-values appeared random (p-values \&gt; 0.05). Given potentially large numbers of statistical tests conducted in the 17 selected base papers, p-hacking cannot be ruled out as explanations for small p-values. Conclusions: Our interpretation of the meta-analysis is that random p-values indicating null associations are more plausible and the meta-analysis is unlikely to replicate in the absence of bias.},

This book pulls back the cover on disagreements between experts charged with restoring integrity to science. It denies two pervasive views of the role of probability in inference: to assign degrees of belief, and to control error rates in a long run. If statistical consumers are unaware of assumptions behind rival evidence reforms, they can't scrutinize the consequences that affect them (in personalized medicine, psychology, etc.). The book sets sail with a simple tool: if little has been done to rule out flaws in inferring a claim, then it has not passed a severe test. Many methods advocated by data experts do not stand up to severe scrutiny and are in tension with successful strategies for blocking or accounting for cherry picking and selective reporting. Through a series of excursions and exhibits, the philosophy and history of inductive inference come alive. Philosophical tools are put to work to solve problems about science and pseudoscience, induction and falsification.},

  abstract = {We review and evaluate selection methods, a prominent class of techniques first proposed by Hedges (1984) that assess and adjust for publication bias in meta-analysis, via an extensive simulation study. Our simulation covers both restrictive settings as well as more realistic settings and proceeds across multiple metrics that assess different aspects of model performance. This evaluation is timely in light of two recently proposed approaches, the so-called p-curve and p-uniform approaches, that can be viewed as alternative implementations of the original Hedges selection method approach. We find that the p-curve and p-uniform approaches perform reasonably well but not as well as the original Hedges approach in the restrictive setting for which all three were designed. We also find they perform poorly in more realistic settings, whereas variants of the Hedges approach perform well. We conclude by urging caution in the application of selection methods: Given the idealistic model assumptions underlying selection methods and the sensitivity of population average effect size estimates to them, we advocate that selection methods should be used less for obtaining a single estimate that purports to adjust for publication bias ex post and more for sensitivity analysis—that is, exploring the range of estimates that result from assuming different forms of and severity of publication bias.},

  abstract = {Background Acute myocardial infarction is triggered by various factors, such as physical exertion, stressful events, heavy meals, or increases in air pollution. However, the importance and relevance of each trigger are uncertain. We compared triggers of myocardial infarction at an individual and population level. Methods We searched PubMed and the Web of Science citation databases to identify studies of triggers of non-fatal myocardial infarction to calculate population attributable fractions (PAF). When feasible, we did a meta-regression analysis for studies of the same trigger. Findings Of the epidemiologic studies reviewed, 36 provided sufficient details to be considered. In the studied populations, the exposure prevalence for triggers in the relevant control time window ranged from 0·04\% for cocaine use to 100\% for air pollution. The reported odds ratios (OR) ranged from 1·05 to 23·7. Ranking triggers from the highest to the lowest OR resulted in the following order: use of cocaine, heavy meal, smoking of marijuana, negative emotions, physical exertion, positive emotions, anger, sexual activity, traffic exposure, respiratory infections, coffee consumption, air pollution (based on a difference of 30 μg/m3 in particulate matter with a diameter {$<$}10 μm [PM10]). Taking into account the OR and the prevalences of exposure, the highest PAF was estimated for traffic exposure (7·4\%), followed by physical exertion (6·2\%), alcohol (5·0\%), coffee (5·0\%), a difference of 30 μg/m3 in PM10 (4·8\%), negative emotions (3·9\%), anger (3·1\%), heavy meal (2·7\%), positive emotions (2·4\%), sexual activity (2·2\%), cocaine use (0·9\%), marijuana smoking (0·8\%) and respiratory infections (0·6\%). Interpretation In view of both the magnitude of the risk and the prevalence in the population, air pollution is an important trigger of myocardial infarction, it is of similar magnitude (PAF 5–7\%) as other well accepted triggers such as physical exertion, alcohol, and coffee. Our work shows that ever-present small risks might have considerable public health relevance. Funding The research on air pollution and health at Hasselt University is supported by a grant from the Flemish Scientific Fund (FWO, Krediet aan navorsers/G.0873.11), tUL-impulse financing, and bijzonder onderzoeksfonds (BOF) and at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven by the sustainable development programme of BELSPO (Belgian Science Policy).},

  abstract = {Observational medical studies are becoming more prominent due to interest in using data from current medical practice to help guide treatment selection. We start by reviewing why current analysis strategies for observational data tend to produce findings that fail to replicate. We then argue that there is a real need for simple and objective statistical strategies that yield findings more likely to be dependable. Our proposed way forward is to focus on the empirical distribution of local treatment differences, LTDs, which reveal heterogeneity in effect-sizes. The LTD is the difference in mean outcomes for treated and control patients within a cluster of patients relatively well matched on their observed pretreatment characteristics. Because we focus on only one question (comparing two alternative treatment choices for a given disease or condition) and clustering is nonparametric, our proposed approach is more simple and objective than commonly used statistical analysis strategies. By studying graphical displays of information from an LTD distribution, a doctor and patient not only can see a full picture of current treatment outcomes but also can make a truly well-informed, individualized treatment choice.},

  abstract = {Claims from observational studies that use traditional model specification searches often fail to replicate, partially because the available data tend to be biased. There is an urgent need for an alternative statistical analysis strategy, that is not only simple and easily understood but also is more likely to give reliable insights when the available data have not been designed and balanced. The alternative strategy known as local control first generates local, nonparametric effect-size estimates (fair treatment comparisons) and only then asks whether the observed variation in these local estimates can be predicted from potential confounding factors. Here, we illustrate application of local control to a historical air pollution data set describing a “natural experiment” initiated by the federal Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970. Our reanalysis reveals subgroup heterogeneity in the effects of air quality regulation on elderly longevity (one size does not fit all), and we show that this heterogeneity is largely explained by socioeconomic and environmental confounders other than air quality.},

  abstract = {Background It is agreed that high level radon exposure is harmful to humans. However, some published literature suggests that low levels of radon show no adverse effects or may even be protective. Claims made using traditional methods of analysis on observational data often fail to replicate. Here, we use a simple, alternative data-analytic strategy for examining effects of low-level indoor radon exposure on lung cancer mortality. One objective will be to demonstrate that local population characteristics can alter expected effects. Methods Observational data on indoor radon exposure levels and lung cancer mortality for 2881 U.S. counties were obtained from federal and state governmental agencies. A new “statistical thinking” step-by-step analysis strategy called Local Control (LC) allows us to perform analyses of observational data that are more objective and “fair” than regression-like methods. LC analytical strategy makes as few and as realistic assumptions as possible. As a result, key LC inferences are nonparametric, and estimates of potentially heterogeneous treatment effect-sizes are robust. Results Our LC analyses suggest that lung cancer mortality usually tends to decrease as background radon exposure increases. Local rank correlation (LRC) effect-sizes are shown to be predictable from confounding local characteristics like percentage of residents over 65, percentage of residents who currently smoke and percentage of obese residents. Conclusions At low indoor radon exposure levels, reverse (negative) LRCs between radon exposure level and lung cancer mortality predominate. The strengths of these associations vary with local demographics.},

  abstract = {Background Air pollution is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Short-term exposure (from one hour to days) to selected air pollutants has been associated with human mortality. This systematic review was conducted to analyse the evidence on the effects of short-term exposure to particulate matter with aerodynamic diameters less or equal than 10 and 2.5~µm (PM10, PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3), on all-cause mortality, and PM10 and PM2.5 on cardiovascular, respiratory, and cerebrovascular mortality. Methods We included studies on human populations exposed to outdoor air pollution from any source, excluding occupational exposures. Relative risks (RRs) per 10~µg/m3 increase in air pollutants concentrations were used as the effect estimates. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed using 80\% prediction intervals. Risk of bias (RoB) in individual studies was analysed using a new domain-based assessment tool, developed by a working group convened by the World Health Organization and designed specifically to evaluate RoB within eligible air pollution studies included in systematic reviews. We conducted subgroup and sensitivity analyses by age, sex, continent, study design, single or multicity studies, time lag, and RoB. The certainty of evidence was assessed for each exposure-outcome combination. The protocol for this review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018087749). Results We included 196 articles in quantitative analysis. All combinations of pollutants and all-cause and cause-specific mortality were positively associated in the main analysis, and in a wide range of sensitivity analyses. The only exception was NO2, but when considering a 1-hour maximum exposure. We found positive associations between pollutants and all-cause mortality for PM10 (RR: 1.0041; 95\% CI: 1.0034–1.0049), PM2.5 (RR: 1.0065; 95\% CI: 1.0044–1.0086), NO2 (24-hour average) (RR: 1.0072; 95\% CI: 1.0059–1.0085), and O3 (RR: 1.0043; 95\% CI: 1.0034–1.0052). PM10 and PM2.5 were also positively associated with cardiovascular, respiratory, and cerebrovascular mortality. We found some degree of heterogeneity between studies in three exposure-outcome combinations, and this heterogeneity could not be explained after subgroup analysis. RoB was low or moderate in the majority of articles. The certainty of evidence was judged as high in 10 out of 11 combinations, and moderate in one combination. Conclusions This study found evidence of a positive association between short-term exposure to PM10, PM2.5, NO2, and O3 and all-cause mortality, and between PM10 and PM2.5 and cardiovascular, respiratory and cerebrovascular mortality. These results were robust through several sensitivity analyses. In general, the level of evidence was high, meaning that we can be confident in the associations found in this study.},

  abstract = {Background: Many researchers have studied the relationship between diet and health. There are papers showing an association between the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and Type 2 diabetes. Many meta-analyses use individual studies that do not adjust for multiple testing or multiple modeling and thus provide biased estimates of effect. Hence the claims reported in a meta-analysis paper may be unreliable if the primary papers do not ensure unbiased estimates of effect. Objective: Determine the statistical reliability of 10 papers and indirectly the reliability of the meta-analysis study. Method: Ten primary papers used in a meta-analysis paper and counted the numbers of outcomes, predictors, and covariates. We estimated the size of the potential analysis search space available to the authors of these papers; i.e. the number of comparisons and models available. Since we noticed that there were differences between predictors and covariates cited in the abstract and in the text, we applied this formula to information found in the abstracts, Space A, as well as the text, Space T, of each primary paper. Results: The median and range of the number of comparisons possible across the primary papers are 6.5 and (2-12,288) for abstracts, and 196,608 and (3,072-117,117,952) the texts. Note that the median of 6.5 for Space A is misleading as each primary study has 60-165 foods not mentioned in the abstract. Conclusion: Given that testing is at the 0.05 level and the number of comparisons is very large, nominal statistical significance is very weak support for a claim. The claims in these papers are not statistically supported and hence are unreliable. Thus, the claims of the meta-analysis paper lack evidentiary confirmation.},

A method iscalled statistical, and thus the subject of study in statistics, if itrelates facts and hypotheses of a particular kind: the empirical factsmust be codified and structured into data sets, and the hypothesesmust be formulated in terms of probability distributions over possibledata sets. The philosophy of statistics concerns the foundations andthe proper interpretation of statistical methods, their input, andtheir results.  Since statistics is relied upon in almost allempirical scientific research, serving to support and communicatescientific findings, the philosophy of statistics is of key importanceto the philosophy of science. It has an impact on the philosophicalappraisal of scientific method, and on the debate over the epistemicand ontological status of scientific theory., The philosophy of statistics harbors a large variety of topics anddebates. Central to these is the  problem of induction,which concerns the justification of inferences or procedures thatextrapolate from data to predictions and general facts. Furtherdebates concern the interpretation of the probabilitiesthat are used in statistics, and the wider theoretical frameworkthat may ground and justify the correctness of statistical methods. Ageneral introduction to these themes is given in Section 1 and Section 2.  Section 3 and  Section 4 provide an account of howthese themes play out in the two major theories of statistical method,classical and Bayesian statistics respectively. Section 5directs attention to the notion of a statistical model, covering modelselection and simplicity, but also discussing statistical techniquesthat do not rely on statistical models.  Section 6 brieflymentions relations between the philosophy of statistics and severalother themes from the philosophy of science, including  confirmation theory, evidence,  causality, measurement, and scientificmethodology in general.},

We applied a “medication-wide association study” approach that combined multivariate analysis with exploratory visualization to study four health outcomes of interest in an administrative claims database of 46 million patients and a clinical database of 11 million patients. The technique had good predictive value, but there was no threshold high enough to eliminate false-positive findings. The visualization not only highlighted the class effects that strengthened the review of specific products but also underscored the challenges in confounding. These findings suggest that observational databases are useful for identifying potential associations that warrant further consideration but are unlikely to provide definitive evidence of causal effects.

  abstract = {The interpretation of statistically significant findings in a carcinogenicity study is difficult, in part because of the large number of statistical tests conducted. Some scientists who believe that the false positive rates in these experiments are unreasonably large often suggest that the use of multiple control groups will provide important insight into the operational false positive rates. The purpose of this paper is 2-fold: to present results from two carcinogenicity studies with dual control groups, and to present and illustrate a new graphical technique potentially useful in the analysis and interpretation of tumor data from carcinogenicity studies. The experimental data analyzed show that statistically significant differences between identically treated groups will occur with regular frequency. Such data, however, do not provide strong evidence of extrabinomial variation in tumor rates. The p-value plot is advocated as a graphical method that can be used to assess visually the ensemble of p values for neoplasm data from an entire study. This technique is then illustrated using several examples. Through computer simulation, we present p-value plots generated with and without treatment effects present. On average, the plots look substantially different depending on the presence or absence of an effect. We also evaluate decision rules motivated by the p-value plots. Such rules appear to have good power to detect treatment effects (i.e., have low false negative rates) while still controlling false positive rates.},

  abstract = {Background Acute exposure to air pollution has been linked to myocardial infarction, but its effect on heart failure is uncertain. We did a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the association between air pollution and acute decompensated heart failure including hospitalisation and heart failure mortality. Methods Five databases were searched for studies investigating the association between daily increases in gaseous (carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone) and particulate (diameter {$<$}2·5 μm [PM2·5] or {$<$}10 μm [PM10]) air pollutants, and heart failure hospitalisations or heart failure mortality. We used a random-effects model to derive overall risk estimates per pollutant. Findings Of 1146 identified articles, 195 were reviewed in-depth with 35 satisfying inclusion criteria. Heart failure hospitalisation or death was associated with increases in carbon monoxide (3·52\% per 1 part per million; 95\% CI 2·52–4·54), sulphur dioxide (2·36\% per 10 parts per billion; 1·35–3·38), and nitrogen dioxide (1·70\% per 10 parts per billion; 1·25–2·16), but not ozone (0·46\% per 10 parts per billion; −0·10 to 1·02) concentrations. Increases in particulate matter concentration were associated with heart failure hospitalisation or death (PM2·5 2·12\% per 10 μg/m3, 95\% CI 1·42–2·82; PM10 1·63\% per 10 μg/m3, 95\% CI 1·20–2·07). Strongest associations were seen on the day of exposure, with more persistent effects for PM2·5. In the USA, we estimate that a mean reduction in PM2·5 of 3·9 μg/m3 would prevent 7978 heart failure hospitalisations and save a third of a billion US dollars a year. Interpretation Air pollution has a close temporal association with heart failure hospitalisation and heart failure mortality. Although more studies from developing nations are required, air pollution is a pervasive public health issue with major cardiovascular and health economic consequences, and it should remain a key target for global health policy.

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies Data sources Medline, Embase, Global Health, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Web of Science searched to January 2014 with no language restrictions. Eligibility criteria Studies investigating the short term associations (up to lag of seven days) between daily increases in gaseous pollutants (carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ozone) and particulate matter ({$<$}2.5 µm or {$<$}10 µm diameter (PM2.5 and PM10)), and admission to hospital for stroke or mortality. Main outcome measures Admission to hospital and mortality from stroke. Results From 2748 articles, 238 were reviewed in depth with 103 satisfying our inclusion criteria and 94 contributing to our meta-estimates. This provided a total of 6.2 million events across 28 countries. Admission to hospital for stroke or mortality from stroke was associated with an increase in concentrations of carbon monoxide (relative risk 1.015 per 1 ppm, 95\% confidence interval 1.004 to 1.026), sulphur dioxide (1.019 per 10 ppb, 1.011 to 1.027), and nitrogen dioxide (1.014 per 10 ppb, 1.009 to 1.019). Increases in PM2.5 and PM10 concentration were also associated with admission and mortality (1.011 per 10 μg/m3 (1.011 to 1.012) and 1.003 per 10 µg/m3 (1.002 to 1.004), respectively). The weakest association was seen with ozone (1.001 per 10 ppb, 1.000 to 1.002). Strongest associations were observed on the day of exposure with more persistent effects observed for PM2·5. Conclusion Gaseous and particulate air pollutants have a marked and close temporal association with admissions to hospital for stroke or mortality from stroke. Public and environmental health policies to reduce air pollution could reduce the burden of stroke. Systematic review registration PROSPERO-CRD42014009225.},

First, we show that despite empirical psychologists’ nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process.},

Data processing often involves choices among several reasonable options for excluding, transforming, and coding data. We suggest that instead of performing only one analysis, researchers could perform a multiverse analysis, which involves performing all analyses across the whole set of alternatively processed data sets corresponding to a large set of reasonable scenarios. Using an example focusing on the effect of fertility on religiosity and political attitudes, we show that analyzing a single data set can be misleading and propose a multiverse analysis as an alternative practice. A multiverse analysis offers an idea of how much the conclusions change because of arbitrary choices in data construction and gives pointers as to which choices are most consequential in the fragility of the result.},

  abstract = {This paper assesses whether ExxonMobil Corporation has in the past misled the general public about climate change. We present an empirical document-by-document textual content analysis and comparison of 187 climate change communications from ExxonMobil, including peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed publications, internal company documents, and paid, editorial-style advertisements (‘advertorials’) in The New York Times . We examine whether these communications sent consistent messages about the state of climate science and its implications—specifically, we compare their positions on climate change as real, human-caused, serious, and solvable. In all four cases, we find that as documents become more publicly accessible, they increasingly communicate doubt. This discrepancy is most pronounced between advertorials and all other documents. For example, accounting for expressions of reasonable doubt, 83\% of peer-reviewed papers and 80\% of internal documents acknowledge that climate change is real and human-caused, yet only 12\% of advertorials do so, with 81\% instead expressing doubt. We conclude that ExxonMobil contributed to advancing climate science—by way of its scientists’ academic publications—but promoted doubt about it in advertorials. Given this discrepancy, we conclude that ExxonMobil misled the public. Our content analysis also examines ExxonMobil’s discussion of the risks of stranded fossil fuel assets. We find the topic discussed and sometimes quantified in 24 documents of various types, but absent from advertorials. Finally, based on the available documents, we outline ExxonMobil’s strategic approach to climate change research and communication, which helps to contextualize our findings.},

Many published studies are difficult or impossible to reproduce because of lack of access to confidential data sources. Here we make publically available a dataset containing daily air quality levels, PM2.5 and ozone, daily temperature levels, minimum and maximum and daily maximum relative humidity levels for the eight most populous California air basins, thirteen years, {$>$}2M deaths, over 37,000 exposure days. The data are analyzed using standard time series analysis, and a sensitivity analysis is computed varying model parameters, locations and years. Our analysis finds little evidence for association between air quality and acute deaths. These results are consistent with those for the widely cited NMMAPS dataset when the latter are restricted to California. The daily death variability was mostly explained by time of year or weather variables; Neither PM2.5 nor ozone added appreciably to the prediction of daily deaths.

  abstract = {Ever since the London Great Smog of 1952 is estimated to have killed over 4000 people, scientists have studied the relationship between air quality and acute mortality. There are many hundreds of papers examining the question. There is a serious statistical problem with most of these papers. If there are many questions under consideration, and there is no adjustment for multiple testing or multiple modeling, then unadjusted p-values are totally unreliable making claims unreliable. Our idea is to determine the statistical reliability of eight papers published in Environmental Health Perspectives that were used in meta-analysis papers appearing in Lancet and JAMA. We counted the number of outcomes, air quality predictors, time lags and covariates examined in each paper. We estimate the multiplicity of questions that could be asked and the number of models that could be constructed. The results were that the median numbers of comparisons possible for multiplicity, models and search space were 135, 128, and 9568 respectively. Given the large search spaces, finding a small number of nominally significant results is not unusual at all. The claims in these eight papers are not statistically supported so these papers are unreliable as are the meta-analysis papers that use them.},

The technical problems include multiple testing, multiple modeling and bias. Any or all of these problems can give rise to claims that will fail to replicate. There is a need for statistical methods that are easily applied, are easy to understand, and are likely to give reliable results. In particular, simple ways for reducing the influence of bias are essential. In this paper, the Local Control method developed by Robert Obenchain is explicated using a small air quality/longevity data set first analyzed in the New England Journal of Medicine. The benefits of our paper are twofold. First, we describe a reliable strategy for analysis of observational data. Second and importantly, the global claim that longevity increases with improvements in air quality made in the NEJM paper needs to be modified. There is subgroup heterogeneity in the effect of air quality on longevity (one size does not fit all), and this heterogeneity is largely explained by factors other than air quality.},

Our idea is to examine the base studies with respect to multiple testing and multiple modeling and to look closer at the meta-analysis using p-value plots. For two meta-analysis we investigated, some extremely small p-values were observed in some of the base studies, which we think are due to a combination of bias and small standard errors. The p-value plot for one meta-analysis indicates no effect. For the other meta-analysis, we note the p-value plot is consistent with a two-component mixture. Small p-values might be real or due to some combination of p-hacking, publication bias, covariate problems, etc. The large p-values could indicate no real effect, or be wrong due to low power, missing covariates, etc. We conclude that the results are ambiguous at best.

A meta-analysis study that includes 14 observational air quality/heart attack studies is examined for its statistical reliability. We use simple counting to evaluate the reliability of the base papers and a p-value plot of the p-values from the base studies to examine study heterogeneity. We find that the base papers have the potential for massive multiple testing and multiple modeling with no statistical adjustments. Statistics coming from the base papers are not guaranteed to be unbiased, a requirement for a valid meta-analysis. There is study heterogeneity for the base papers with strong evidence for so called p-hacking in some, possibly many, of the studies. We make two observations: there are many claims at issue in each of the 14 base studies so uncorrected multiple testing is a serious issue. We find that some of the base papers exhibit the characteristics of p-hacking and are therefore not reliable; the resulting meta-analysis is not reliable.},

A study was undertaken to assess the reliability of cohort studies used in a highly cited meta-analysis of the association between ambient nitrogen dioxide, NO2, and fine particulate matter, PM2.5, concentrations early in life and development of asthma later in life. The numbers of statistical tests possible were estimated for 19 base papers considered for the meta-analysis. A p-value plot for NO2 and PM2.5 was constructed to evaluate effect heterogeneity of p-values used from the base papers. The numbers of statistical tests possible in the base papers were large - median 13,824, interquartile range 1,536-221,184; range 96-42M, in comparison to statistical test results presented. Statistical test results drawn from the base papers are unlikely to provide unbiased measures for meta-analysis. The p-value plot indicated that heterogeneity of the NO2 results across the base papers is consistent with a two-component mixture. First, it makes no sense to average across a mixture in meta-analysis. Second, the shape of the p-value plot for NO2 appears consistent with the possibility of analysis manipulation to obtain small p-values in several of the cohort studies. As for PM2.5, all corresponding p-values fall on a 45-degree line indicating complete randomness rather than a true association. Our interpretation of the meta-analysis is that the random p-values indicating no cause-effect associations are more plausible and that their meta-analysis will not likely replicate in the absence of bias. We conclude that claims made in the base papers used for meta-analysis are unreliable due to bias induced by multiple testing and multiple modelling, MTMM. We also show there is evidence that the heterogeneity across the base papers used for meta-analysis is more complex than simple sampling from a normal process.},

  abstract = {Since the London Great Smog of 1952 was estimated to have killed over 4000 people, scientists have studied the relationship between air quality and acute mortality. Currently, the association between air quality and acute deaths is usually taken as evidence for causality. As air quality has markedly improved since 1952, do contemporary datasets support this view? We use a large dataset, eight air basins in California for the years 2004–2007, to examine the possible association of ozone and PM2.5 with acute deaths after statistically removing seasonal and weather effects. Our analysis dataset is available on request. We conducted a regression-corrected, case-crossover analysis for all non-accidental deaths age 75 and older. We used stepwise regression to examine three causes of death. After seasonal and weather adjustments, there was essentially no predictive power of ozone or PM2.5 for acute deaths. The case-crossover analysis produced odds ratio very close to 1.000 (no effect). The very narrow confidence limits indicated good statistical power. We study recent air quality in both time-stratified, symmetric, bidirectional case-crossover and time series regression and both give consistent results. There is no statistically significant association between either ozone or PM2.5 and acute human mortality. In the absence of an association, causality is in question.},

  abstract = {Background Air pollution constitutes a significant stimulus of asthma exacerbations; however, the impacts of exposure to major air pollutants on asthma-related hospital admissions and emergency room visits (ERVs) have not been fully determined. Objective We sought to quantify the associations between short-term exposure to air pollutants [ozone (O3), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter ≤10μm (PM10) and PM2.5] and the asthma-related emergency room visits (ERV) and hospitalizations. Methods Systematic computerized searches without language limitation were performed. Pooled relative risks (RRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (95\%CIs) were estimated using the random-effect models. Sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses were also performed. Results After screening of 246 studies, 87 were included in our analyses. Air pollutants were associated with significantly increased risks of asthma ERVs and hospitalizations [O3: RR(95\%CI), 1.009 (1.006, 1.011); I2 = 87.8\%, population-attributable fraction (PAF) (95\%CI): 0.8 (0.6, 1.1); CO: RR(95\%CI), 1.045 (1.029, 1.061); I2 = 85.7\%, PAF (95\%CI): 4.3 (2.8, 5.7); NO2: RR(95\%CI), 1.018 (1.014, 1.022); I2 = 87.6\%, PAF (95\%CI): 1.8 (1.4, 2.2); SO2: RR(95\%CI), 1.011 (1.007, 1.015); I2 = 77.1\%, PAF (95\%CI): 1.1 (0.7, 1.5); PM10: RR(95\%CI), 1.010 (1.008, 1.013); I2 = 69.1\%, PAF (95\%CI): 1.1 (0.8, 1.3); PM2.5: RR(95\%CI), 1.023 (1.015, 1.031); I2 = 82.8\%, PAF (95\%CI): 2.3 (1.5, 3.1)]. Sensitivity analyses yielded compatible findings as compared with the overall analyses without publication bias. Stronger associations were found in hospitalized males, children and elderly patients in warm seasons with lag of 2 days or greater. Conclusion Short-term exposures to air pollutants account for increased risks of asthma-related ERVs and hospitalizations that constitute a considerable healthcare utilization and socioeconomic burden.},
