\title{Test linearity of a QQ-plot}
\usage{
qq_linear(studies, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{studies}{A dataframe of studies, as returned by \code{draw_studies()}. Minimally, a dataframe with columns \code{p.uniform} and \code{p.value}.}

\item{alpha}{Threshold for statistical significance; used by the automated F-test.}
}
\value{
A one-row \code{tibble::tibble} with the following columns:
\item{f_stat}{Observed value of the F statistic}
\item{alpha}{Threshold for statistical significance used in the F-test}
\item{f_p}{p-value of the F statistic}
\item{f_comp}{Inference from the F-test; one of \code{significant} or \code{non-significant}}
\item{aic_linear}{AIC statistic of the linear regression}
\item{aic_quad}{AIC statistic of the quadratic regression}
\item{aic_comp}{Inference from comparing AICs; one of \code{quadratic} or \code{linear}}
}
\description{
Checks the linearity of a QQ-plot (against a uniform distribution) by comparing linear and quadratic regressions of \code{p.value} against \code{p.uniform}.
}
\details{
Two checks are used: an F-test for the ANOVA of the two regression models, and a comparison of AICs.
